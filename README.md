# üöÄ CI/CD Stack with Docker Compose

This project provides a set of production-ready `docker-compose.yml` files to deploy a complete, isolated **CI/CD stack** on your local machine.  

The setup includes:
- **Jenkins** for automation  
- **Nexus** for artifact management  
- **SonarQube** for code quality analysis  
- **Nginx reverse proxy** for unified access  

---

## üì¶ Project Components

This stack is built using the following services, each running in its own container:

- **Jenkins**: Automation server for build, test, and deployment pipelines. Persistent volume stores all job data.  
- **Nexus Repository Manager**: Central artifact repository for managing project dependencies (Maven, npm, etc).  
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis. Backed by PostgreSQL database for persistence.  
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Routes requests based on domain names. Provides single entry point for all services.
